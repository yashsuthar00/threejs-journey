# 🚀 My Learning Progress

## 🎨 Three.js Progress
This section tracks my journey with Three.js, where I’ve built various projects and learned important concepts:

---

### 🟦 **Basic Cube Setup**

*Learned about setting up the scene, camera, and renderer. Created a basic rotating cube.*

*Applied transformations (position, rotation, scaling) and explored keyframe animations along different axes.*

---

### 💡 **Lighting and Shadows**

*Explored different types of lights (ambient, directional, point) and implemented realistic shadows in the scene.*

*Gained deeper knowledge about mesh scaling, rotation, and positioning to control object behavior precisely.*
