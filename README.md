# 🚀 My Learning Progress

## 🎨 Three.js Progress
This section tracks my journey with Three.js, where I’ve built various projects and learned important concepts:

---

### 🟦 **Basic Cube Setup**

*Learned about setting up the scene, camera, and renderer. Created a basic rotating cube.*

---

### 🔄 **Transformations and Animations**

*Applied transformations (position, rotation, scaling) and explored keyframe animations along different axes.*

---

### 💡 **Lighting and Shadows**

*Explored different types of lights (ambient, directional, point) and implemented realistic shadows in the scene.*

---

### 📏 **Deep Understanding**

*Explored `CylinderGeometry` to create cylindrical meshes and experimented with different material properties.*

---

### 🎨 **Textures and Materials**  
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo-GitHub-black?logo=github)](https://github.com/yashsuthar00/threejs-journey/tree/main/08-materials-textures) [![Live](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-blue?logo=google-chrome)](https://08-texture-geometry.netlify.app/)  
*Learned how to apply textures to meshes and integrate the `lil-gui` library for real-time property adjustments.*

---

### 💡 **Advanced Lighting and Helpers**  
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo-GitHub-black?logo=github)](https://github.com/yashsuthar00/threejs-journey/tree/main/09-lightings) [![Live](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-blue?logo=google-chrome)](https://09-lightings.netlify.app/)  
*Explored advanced lighting setups with ambient, point, and directional lights. Implemented light helpers for better debugging.*

---

### 📦 **Adding 3D Models**  
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo-GitHub-black?logo=github)](https://github.com/yashsuthar00/threejs-journey/tree/main/10-3d-models) [![Live](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-blue?logo=google-chrome)](https://10-add3dmodel.netlify.app/)  
*Learned how to import 3D models using GLB files and integrate HDRI for realistic environment reflections.*

---

### ⚛️ **React Three Fiber (R3F)**  
[![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo-GitHub-black?logo=github)](https://github.com/yashsuthar00/threejs-journey/tree/main/12-R3F) [![Live](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-blue?logo=google-chrome)](https://12-r3f-learning.netlify.app/)  
*Applied all the above concepts using React Three Fiber, a powerful Three.js library for React, to create declarative 3D scenes.*
