# 🚀 My Learning Progress

## 🎨 Three.js Progress
This section tracks my journey with Three.js, where I’ve built various projects and learned important concepts:

- **🟦 [Basic Cube Setup](https://yashsuthar00.github.io/threejs-journey/01-basic-cube)**  
  *Learned about setting up the scene, camera, and renderer. Created a basic rotating cube.*

- **🔄 [Transformations and Animations](https://yashsuthar00.github.io/threejs-journey/02-transformations-animations)**  
  *Applied transformations (position, rotation, scaling) and explored keyframe animations along different axes.*

- **💡 [Lighting and Shadows](https://yashsuthar00.github.io/threejs-journey/04-lighting-shadows)**  
  *Explored different types of lights (ambient, directional, point) and implemented realistic shadows in the scene.*

- **📏 [Deep Understanding](https://yashsuthar00.github.io/threejs-journey/05-deepUnderstanding)**  
  *Gained deeper knowledge about mesh scaling, rotation, and positioning to control object behavior precisely.*
