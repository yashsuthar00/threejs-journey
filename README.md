# ðŸš€ My Learning Progress

## ðŸŽ¨ Three.js Progress
This section tracks my journey with Three.js, where Iâ€™ve built various projects and learned important concepts:

- **ðŸŸ¦ [Basic Cube Setup](https://yashsuthar00.github.io/threejs-journey/01-basic-cube)**  
  *Learned about setting up the scene, camera, and renderer. Created a basic rotating cube.*

- **ðŸ”„ [Transformations and Animations](https://yashsuthar00.github.io/threejs-journey/02-transformations-animations)**  
  *Applied transformations (position, rotation, scaling) and explored keyframe animations along different axes.*
